# Pipeline Optimization Guide

## Current Performance Issues

### Main Workflow (`000-mono-main.yml`)
- **Total Time**: ~8-15 minutes
- **Jobs**: 5 sequential jobs
- **Bottlenecks**:
  - Maven build: 3-8 minutes
  - Docker multi-arch build: 2-5 minutes
  - Coverage reporting: 1-2 minutes

### Develop Workflow (`001-mono-develop.yml`)
- **Total Time**: ~7-12 minutes
- **Similar structure to main workflow**

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Parallel Job Execution
**File**: `.github/workflows/000-mono-main-optimized.yml`

**Changes**:
- Docker build now runs in parallel with build-test (only depends on woke)
- Added timeouts to prevent hanging jobs
- Removed unnecessary job dependencies

**Expected Improvement**: 2-4 minutes faster

### 2. Maven Build Optimizations
**Files**: `pom.xml`, `.mvn/maven.config`

**Changes**:
- Parallel test execution (`maven.test.parallel=true`)
- Multiple test forks (`maven.test.forkCount=2`)
- Incremental compilation
- Batch mode for CI
- Built-in Maven caching in GitHub Actions

**Expected Improvement**: 1-3 minutes faster

### 3. Docker Build Optimizations
**File**: `Dockerfile`

**Changes**:
- Multi-stage build with dependency caching
- Separate dependency resolution stage
- Optimized Maven settings in Docker build
- Better layer caching

**Expected Improvement**: 1-2 minutes faster

### 4. Fast PR Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/pr-fast.yml`

**Changes**:
- Lightweight checks for PRs
- Skips heavy operations (Docker build, coverage upload)
- Focuses on essential validation

**Expected Improvement**: 5-8 minutes faster for PRs

## Performance Comparison

| Workflow | Current Time | Optimized Time | Improvement |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Main Branch | 8-15 min | 5-10 min | 30-40% |
| Develop Branch | 7-12 min | 4-8 min | 35-45% |
| PR Checks | 8-15 min | 3-7 min | 50-60% |

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Immediate)
1. ✅ Add Maven optimizations to `pom.xml`
2. ✅ Create `.mvn/maven.config`
3. ✅ Optimize Dockerfile
4. ✅ Create fast PR workflow

### Phase 2: Workflow Optimization (Next)
1. Replace main workflow with optimized version
2. Update develop workflow similarly
3. Test performance improvements

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Future)
1. Consider using larger runners for heavy builds
2. Implement build matrix for different architectures
3. Add conditional job execution based on file changes

## Monitoring Performance

### GitHub Actions Metrics
- Use GitHub's built-in workflow analytics
- Monitor job duration trends
- Track cache hit rates

### Key Metrics to Watch
- Build time per commit
- Cache effectiveness
- Test execution time
- Docker build time

## Rollback Plan

If optimizations cause issues:
1. Revert to original workflow files
2. Remove Maven optimizations from `pom.xml`
3. Restore original Dockerfile
4. Delete `.mvn/maven.config`

## Best Practices for Future

1. **Keep workflows focused**: Each job should have a single responsibility
2. **Use caching effectively**: Cache dependencies, build artifacts, and Docker layers
3. **Parallel execution**: Run independent jobs in parallel
4. **Conditional execution**: Skip jobs when not needed
5. **Monitor performance**: Regularly review build times and optimize bottlenecks
