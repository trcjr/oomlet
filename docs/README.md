3. **Deploys** to `https://trcjr.github.io/oomlet`

## Local Development

# From the project root directory
./scripts/serve-docs-simple.sh
```

**Option 3: Docker with custom script**
```bash
# From the project root directory
./scripts/serve-docs-docker.sh
```

**Option 4: Manual Docker Compose**
```bash
# Build project and copy coverage reports
./mvnw clean verify
rm -rf docs/jacoco
cp -r target/site/jacoco docs/

# Install dependencies and start server
cd docs
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/srv/jekyll" -w /srv/jekyll jekyll/jekyll:4.2.2 bundle install
cd ..
docker-compose -f docker-compose.docs.yml up
```
